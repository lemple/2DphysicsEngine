//main purpose of this class is to be able to read a file into a buffer
//without having to rewrite the code everytime
//I made this class a static class as there only needs to be one instance of the class
//so therefore there is no need in making the class anything else.

     * @brief readFileToBuffer
     * reads a file into the buffer.
     * parameters: pass in the buffer by reference. the way this works is the user will
     * pass in there own empty vector and the function will fill the data with the data they need.
     *
     * @param filePath
     *            Define the file path thats being passed in using vecotor.
     * @param buffer
     *            Passes in the buffer from the user so it will only fill the data it needs
     *
     * @return
     *            Returns true if the program opens the file
